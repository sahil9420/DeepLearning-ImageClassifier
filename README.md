# DeepLearning-ImageClassifier
Deep Learning with TensorFlow:
It uses MNIST dataset, which is a dataset that contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples of hand-written and labeled digits, 0 through 9, so ten total "classes."
# Kmeans Titanic Dataset
K-Means algorithm to the Titanic dataset. The K-Means algorithm is a flat-clustering algorithm, which means we need to tell the machine only one thing: How many clusters there ought to be. We're going to tell the algorithm to find two groups, and we're expecting that the machine finds survivors and non-survivors mostly in the two groups it picks.
